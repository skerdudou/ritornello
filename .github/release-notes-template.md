**Action required** — the root mount helper for network shares,
`files-mount`, changed (it now remounts a share whose "writable" setting
changed). Only `ritornello-install` may place it, so the update page refuses
to update the `files` plugin with "update with ritornello-install" until it
is run. The core and the other plugins update from the page as usual.

`files-mount` now carries its own number, independent of the product's:
it moves from `0.2.0-beta.3` to `1.0.1`, and from now on it only moves when
the helper itself changes — so this installer run is not one you will be
asked for at every release.

Take the installer for your computer from its permanent link (the README's
Download table, or `releases/download/installer/<file>`), then:

```sh
./ritornello-install --host account@device --keep
```

This installer leaves alone what is already up to date. Its first run on a
device installed by an older installer places every plugin and pack once
more — the older one did not record them — and later runs only what changed.
<!-- The opening block above is this release's answer to "is there anything
     to do by hand?", and it is rewritten at every release rather than left
     to rot. When the next one needs nothing, the whole block above becomes
     one line:

     **Nothing to do** — replace the binaries.

     and when it does need something, it stays as it is here:

     **Action required** — <what to do by hand>.

     In 0.x semver the minor carries breaks, so the digit alone cannot say
     this. The sentence can.

     Action required when this release changes any of:

     - a systemd unit (`deploy/*.service`)
     - a polkit rule (`deploy/*.rules`)
     - `ritornello-media-mount`, the helper root runs for network shares
       (the `files-mount` companion archive, which only ritornello-install
       places)

     The updater cannot write any of those, by design. Say so here, with the
     command, or the device will update its binaries and silently keep the
     old unit. -->

## Behaviour changes

New: a "Full journal" on the System page. The core now relays every
plugin's own output into its log, prefixed with the plugin's name, and keeps
the latest lines (errors apart) for the page to show. A stream URL is never
written there by the `musicbrainz` plugin.

The `generic-input` plugin reopens a remote receiver that is unplugged and
plugged back in, without a restart, and warns once per device node rather
than on every retry.

The `files-mount` helper remounts a network share whose "writable" setting
changed, instead of keeping it in the old mode until the next reboot.

Fewer downloads: a component whose own code did not change now keeps its
number, so a device only fetches what really moved — here the core, `files`,
`generic-input`, `musicbrainz` and the language packs. The installer is now
published on its own channel (see Action required above).

## Install

Common case — the core and every plugin:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
sudo tar --no-same-owner -C / -xzf ritornello-core-<version>-<arch>.tar.gz
sudo tar --no-same-owner -C / -xzf ritornello-plugins-<version>-<arch>.tar.gz
sudo chown -R ritornello: /etc/ritornello
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart ritornello
```

`--no-same-owner` is belt and braces, not a workaround: the archives are
built with every entry owned by `root`, and the packaging script refuses to
produce one that is not. But extracting as root restores whatever ownership
an archive carries, so the flag makes the recipe safe even for an archive
built before that rule existed — a polkit rules file (JavaScript `polkitd`
runs as root) owned by a non-root uid is a local privilege escalation.

Each archive holds the tree as it will exist on the device, and holds no
configuration you may have edited: `stations.toml`, `input-bindings.toml` and
`plugins.toml` are never in it. Example files and the `plugins.toml` block of
each plugin travel beside the tree, to be copied by hand.

Replacing a single plugin is the same two commands with that plugin's archive.

The `files` plugin needs its companion, `ritornello-files-mount`, which
carries the root mount helper, its unit and its polkit rule: the plugin's own
archive does not. After installing `ritornello-plugin-files` together with
`ritornello-files-mount` (or the bundle, which carries both) for the first
time:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable ritornello-media-mount.service
```

Enabled, **not** started: what it is enabled for is machine boot, where it
reconciles the declared network shares. Skip it and declared shares silently
stop being mounted after a reboot.

A language pack (`ritornello-lang-<language>-<version>.tar.gz`) is not part
of the recipe above, and not part of any component's archive either. It is
**flat** — `pack.toml` plus one file per plugin it covers, no leading
path — so the `tar -C /` above must never be run against it: doing so drops
those files straight into `/`. Install one from the config page, where the
core fetches, verifies and writes it itself with no privileged step at all;
or, by hand, extract it into its own directory:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ritornello/language-packs/ritornello-lang-<language>
sudo tar --no-same-owner -C /etc/ritornello/language-packs/ritornello-lang-<language> \
  -xzf ritornello-lang-<language>-<version>.tar.gz
sudo chown -R ritornello: /etc/ritornello/language-packs/ritornello-lang-<language>
```

## What this release carries

This release carries the components whose own version moved since the
previous one. When `PROTOCOL_VERSION` or the product's major changed, every
component moved (the release script refuses a wire break that left a core or
plugin on its old number). A component missing from the assets below is
unchanged, not removed — do not read its absence as a regression.

**If a shared crate changed** (`ritornello-proto`, `ritornello-i18n`,
`ritornello-plugin-sdk`, `ritornello-updater`) compatibly, nothing was
republished for it: devices install on version inequality alone, so a
component only reaches them under a new number. If the fix must reach a
plugin, that plugin's version must have been bumped by hand in the same
commit.

The version in an attached file's name is that **component's** own version,
not this release's tag: `ritornello-plugin-radio-0.2.1-<arch>.tar.gz` says
nothing about the tag it ships under. Only `ritornello-plugins-<version>`,
the bundle of every plugin, is named after this release's own tag.

**Never delete a published release or its attached files.** The appliance
goes back to fetch, from there, the components that have not changed since.

## Architectures

- `armv7` — Raspberry Pi 2 and similar, the reference hardware.
- `x86_64` — PC/server; the target this project's tests and end-to-end
  journeys run on.
- `arm64` — Pi 3/4/5 class. **Cross-compiled but never started on hardware**,
  for lack of a device to try it on.
